# üé≠ Shadow Orchestrator

> **Coordinate specialized AI agents for production-grade software development**

Shadow Orchestrator is a comprehensive template system that enables semantic orchestration of specialized AI agents. Instead of generic prompting, invoke expert roles with specific knowledge, methodologies, and best practices for every aspect of software development.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Installation**

**Option A: One-line install (Recommended)**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpriment626/shadow-orchestra/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Option B: Manual setup**
- **Claude Code**: Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your project directory
- **ChatGPT/Other**: Copy the entire repository or specific role files
- **API Integration**: Use the role templates in your custom AI workflows

### 2. **Invoke Specialized Agents**
```
"Use the planner role to create a PRD for a social media app"
"As an architect, design microservices for 100k users"
"Use the backend role to create a REST API for user management"
"As a frontend engineer, build a responsive dashboard"
```

### 3. **Multi-Agent Workflows**
```
"Build a secure user authentication system"
‚Üí Automatically coordinates:
  1. Architect (system design)
  2. Backend Engineer (API implementation) 
  3. Frontend Engineer (login UI)
  4. Security Engineer (security hardening)
  5. QA Engineer (comprehensive testing)
  6. Git Specialist (organized commits)
```

- `"Build React components..."` ‚Üí Frontend Engineer
- `"Test this feature..."` ‚Üí QA Engineer

### **Automated Best Practices**
Every specialist enforces production standards:
- ‚úÖ **Security-first development** with automatic hardening
- ‚úÖ **Quality gates** with 80%+ test coverage requirements
- ‚úÖ **Clean git history** with conventional commits
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimization** built into every implementation
- ‚úÖ **Compliance ready** with GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2 frameworks

### **Production-Ready Outputs**
Each role provides complete, implementable solutions:
- üìã **Comprehensive documentation** and implementation guides
- üîß **Real-world code examples** and configuration templates
- üìä **Quality metrics** and acceptance criteria
- üö® **Error handling** and monitoring strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Patterns

### **Claude Code Integration**
1. Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your project root
2. Reference role templates in subdirectories
3. Use semantic commands naturally in your development workflow

### **Custom AI Platform Integration**
```python
# Example: Custom orchestrator integration
def invoke_specialist(role_name, task_description):
    role_template = load_template(f"roles/{role_name}.md")
    specialized_prompt = f"{role_template}\n\nTask: {task_description}"
    return ai_client.complete(specialized_prompt)

# Multi-agent coordination
def coordinate_feature_development(feature_request):
    plan = invoke_specialist("planner", feature_request)
    architecture = invoke_specialist("architect", plan)
    backend = invoke_specialist("backend_engineer", architecture)
    frontend = invoke_specialist("frontend_engineer", architecture)
    security = invoke_specialist("security_engineer", f"{backend}\n{frontend}")
    tests = invoke_specialist("qa_engineer", f"{backend}\n{frontend}")
    return coordinate_implementation([backend, frontend, security, tests])
```

### **Team Workflow Integration**
```bash
# Git workflow with automated specialist coordination
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system

Backend: JWT auth with Redis sessions
Frontend: Login/register components  
Security: Rate limiting, input validation
Testing: Auth flow E2E tests
QA: Security scan passed
